            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Ingenious Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have here exhibited to thy view, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Bloud</hi> according to many years Obſervation, written in my Mother Tongue (not without Scholaſtick Terms intermixed:) that the greater Benefit may be reaped by my Country-men, I requeſt thee to read it without any Raſh Judgment; first duly weighing ſome Problems or Propoſitions. I conceive if thou beeſt unſatisfied whether Opening a Vein as it is indicated from Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Revulſion be a competent ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the Cure of a Pleuriſie, or any high Feaver; thou ſhalt find in this ſhort Tract a Reſolution in a Negative ſenſe, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reaſon, Authority, but eſpecially that which is the ſum of All, Matter of Fact deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered according to what Experiments are
<pb facs="tcp:108903:7"/> paſt, offered to be made good for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>I beg nothing by way of conceſsion, neither do I obtrude or pin any thing upon thy ſleeve. Whom Juſt, Equal, often repeated conſtant Trials will not convince, nothing but a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yea hardly that will convert ſuch an one from his Obſtinacy. Be as you pleaſe Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yielding to what I have ſet down, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and Refractory, I am indifferent, ſith I have improv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d my Talent in giving thee a ſerious advertiſement what miſchiefs may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this indirect courſe of Practice. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I doubt not the time will come, yea is not far of, that a Phlebotomiſt (as I have here cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized him) will be looked upon little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Bronchotomiſt, a Cut-throat, as ſoon as the Harveſt of Noble Remedies come to full maturity: a large Crop whereof would quickly appear if well cultivated by Learned Phyſiologers. I am fully perſwaded a hidden Treaſure of Medicines far tranſcending theſe vulgar now in uſe, would ſoon be detected, and kindly accepted if the evil Morality of this moſt vitious Age did not intercept ſo great a bleſsing. For my own part, I am ready, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to exert all the ſinews of ſtrength I have in my faculty, for the ſanative Inſtructions of languiſhing man, although my Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>iation hath
<pb facs="tcp:108903:7"/> been nought elſe hitherto but odious, Ingratitude from moſt, whoſe Lives I study to ſave in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way.</p>
            <p>Aſſuredly, were it not for fear of a greater diminution of the Honour of the Art, the danger of eclipſing the Repute and Credit of a Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Phyſician, the proſtitution or debaſement of <hi>Arcana's</hi> (it being a ſin to caſt Pearls before Swine) had I not ſeen the ſad effects of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medical Bills in Apothecaries ſhops, I ſhould without farther delay openly produce thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which would (in deſpight of the greateſt Patrons thereof) ſtop the Orifice of this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Galenical Sanguimiſsion. Now ſith this cannot be done, I am ready to reſolve any one who is capable, that the moſt Plethorick Body taken with a Feaver, or any one Cachochymick afflicted with a Pleuriſie may be cured without the Lancet more ſpeedily, ſoundly, and ſafely, than uſing the ſame. I know this will ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who are not acquainted with our Chymical Philoſophy, being nurſed up in this Ignorant way of Phlebotomy, being hurryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by ſome private Intereſt, ingaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a peculiar favour for ſome Relation, or Eminent Doctors their choice friends, who have infuſed this Opinion of Bleeding into them as Authentick, ſo that they had rather go to the Grave by this means with their fore-fathers
<pb facs="tcp:108903:8"/> following the French faſhion, than to live to be Wiſer. Such I ſhall leave to their own fancies as unreclaimable, bewitched by thoſe with whom I am bound to conteſt, whom I principally charge as Anteſignani, Ring-leaders of this ſanguinary effuſion. Theſe I queſtion not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reduce to a better Judgment if they ſtand to it, or if they ſhrink back, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear they are no better than Fugitives or Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades in Phyſick. If what I have laid open be ſo far prevalent as any way to reform the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Healing, that the poor man travelling in this valley of Tears, lying wounded by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Diſeaſes, unpityed by the Galenical Prieſt and Levite, may receive ſuccour from the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Samaritane, I ſhall account it reward ſufficient. Howſoever I ſhall reſt contented, that what I have delivered is Truth, not to be destroyed by all the Powers of Darkneſs.</p>

                  <p>THe Air, Climate, and Food, do not a little alter the bloud of all <hi>Animals:</hi> For crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that live in lofty places more remote from the faeculent exhalations of the Earth, (for as much as they participate of a more ſubtile, clean, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale) have their bloud more rarified, volatilized, and ſo conſequently Circulation the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without thoſe Coagulations or Grumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, which thoſe reſting nigh the lower ſurface of the Globe, always ſending out ſome noxious emanations, are commonly incident to. Hereupon the winged common-wealth that frequently draw breath in a ſublimer Region, have their juices for the moſt part better digeſted, mundified, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized, than thoſe which are conſtantly contiguous to the earth. For it is certain, look <hi>(Coeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus)</hi> what air you draw in, ſuch accordingly is the texture of the vital ſpirits, as theſe are generated good or bad, ſo likewiſe is the bloud, as this is conſtituted, ſo are the Carneous, Membranous, and Oſſeous parts.</p>
                  <p>Laudable or depraved food conduces much to the meliorating or <hi>pejorating</hi> this animal liquor, for as the diet is regulated in Quality or Quantity, ſo

                  <p>It would take up too much time ſtrictly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this vital juice in ſeveral ſpecies, and in certain Individuals, whoſe Qualities, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Endowments, Inclinations, Affections, Actions, and Paſſions depend upon the Seed, the exquiſite eſſential part of this animal Balſom, both of which make up <hi>Stamen &amp; Subtegmen,</hi> the Warpe and Woofe of every creature.

                  <p>THe Galeniſts have reckoned for this ſixteen hundred years, four humours analogous to the four Elements in mans body requiſite for the eſſential <hi>conſtitution</hi> of this ruddy maſs, all of which they affirm are ſeparable and demonſtrable to the eye.

                  <p>Now theſe Peripatetick Philoſophers deliver to the World, that the contexture of this vital juice is made up of choler, phlegm, melancholly and bloud, which united, produce as they would have it, the compounded body we call <hi>Sanguis:</hi> how groſly erroneous and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108903:12"/>
                  <p>Wherefore we conclude with that Noble Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, that bloud is an univocal ſubſtance, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible only by ſome external accidental means, as the air or fire which cauſe a various texture, and different poſition of its atoms, whereby it ſeems to conſiſt of thoſe parts which are not really inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in it, as is manifeſt in its degeneration from its native colour, ſapour, conſiſtence, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which it had, before it became corrupt in the Porringer, or underwent the torture of the fire: Both of which do ſtrangely larvate and diſguiſe this puniteous Balſom, giving occaſion to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts to frame their four fictitious humours no where really exſiſtent. Hence occaſion hath been given of taking wrong indications in the cure of thoſe Diſeaſes (eaſily ſanable if a firm foundation were laid) a great Catalogue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have been reputed incurable.</p>
                  <p>Had they but conſidered how this vital moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ebbs and flows in goodneſs and pravity upon flight accidental occaſions of any exorbitant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as Fear, Sorrow, Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the manifold impreſſions of the ambient air, <hi>Ill Diet,</hi> immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſe, divers exceſſive evacuations, and long retention of any recrement: Did they rightly underſtand how bloud like Mercury may be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymorphiſed and changed into divers ſhapes, and at length be retroduced to the ſame ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as when it was in its Primitive eſſence: certainly then theſe Dogmatiſts would never be ſo forward to pierce poor mans skin, raſhly let out and throw away that ſubſtantial ſupport of life, fooliſhly and falſly apprehending that to be totally corrupt and deprived of what it was in its former being, and in no wiſe capable to be retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108903:12"/> and return to it ſelf again; becauſe it ſeems to their eyes when it appears abroad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, inveſted with a contemptible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, as Yellow, Green, White, Blew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover, one would think it ſhould put a ſtop to their prodigal profuſe bleeding, if they did but meditate with what difficulty Nature brings this ſolar Liquor to perfection, how many hazards of becoming ſpurious and abortive it paſſes through; how eaſily it is ſtained by an extraneous tincture; how often intermixed with ſomething allogeneous and hoſtile to it; how many elaborate circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, digeſtions, and refinings it undergoes before it be throughly animated, and made fit for the right uſe of the immortal ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may be informed concerning the efficient and material cauſe of this vital juice, let us contemplate its original, the place where 'tis firſt generated, or conception, as an <hi>Embryon</hi> of its Nativity, Growth, and full Maturity.</p>
                  <p>The proper <hi>Womb</hi> where the bloud receives a previous Rudiment, earneſt or ſignature, of what Nature intends to perfect by degrees, is the ſtomach, where by vertue of a vigorous ferment, the food is converted into a whitiſh Chyle ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacide ſomewhat fixed, agreeable to the part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving or containing, and to the ſubordinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe, that is employed in this notable change of what is ingeſted. After the Chyle hath continued ſo long in the ſtomach, that it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that ſcope Nature hath intended: it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of this veſſel, either oppreſſed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, or ſtirred up with an extimulating ſharpneſs, which makes an apertion of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus, through which it paſſes into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108903:13"/> 
                     <hi>Jejunum,</hi> and <hi>Ilion,</hi> where a very bitter, yet a moſt balſamical dark deeply tinged Condiment attending the foreſaid Acide juice, ſtrait converts the ſame into a ſaline exceedingly <hi>Volatilized</hi> chyme, the more pure rarifyed part of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made capable and pervious, is ſucked up by thoſe inviſible lacteous veſſels implanted in the meſentery, the more impure and groſſer is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged through the Inteſtines. In theſe ſmal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulary cavities runs this innocent white Liquor through the Pancreas, into the deſcending Trunk Vena Cava, and through the <hi>Thorax,</hi> into the <hi>Subclavian Veins,</hi> by means of which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the right ventricle of the heart dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, where intermixt with the bloud it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately altered in ſeveral accidents, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Character or Idaea of vitality by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an inherent ferment concurring. Upon the contraction of the heart the valves belonging to the <hi>Cava,</hi> hindring regreſs, a fair way is laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for its free egreſs through the Arteria pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, into that ſpongy body the Lungs, in which part it is freed from ſome foulneſs and Droſs which this Porous Parenchyma in its filtration as it were imbibes and ſeparates, (the ambient Air inſpired, much conducing to the mundification, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction of the ſame bright red juice by helping the fermentation thereof, and ſending out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nocuous exhalations in expiration. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being thus far prepared, it is at lenght brought down by <hi>Vena Pulmonica,</hi> into the left ventricle of the heart expanding, whence it is more vitalized and graduated in its excellency, and by a ſtrong ſudden conſtriction yirked and exploded by the Arteries meliorating it through
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108903:13"/> the extream Orifices of the fore-named veſſels into all parts of the body, where ſome portion is aſſimilated into the Identical ſubſtance of that which is to be nouriſhed, what juice fitting being ſpent in aſſimilation, the reſt is taken up by the veins returning it to the right ventricle, and ſo through the Lungs to the left: where it is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a greater degree of perfection (by often Circulation) part of which is made fit for the generation of vital ſpirits, Accretion, Nutrition, and Procreation. Thus much concerning the material cauſe of bloud. Now the Efficient or Agent is the innate <hi>Archeus</hi> or vital ſpirit, which chiefly makes this formal Tranſmutation of whatſoever is nouriſhable. This works by his principal inſtrument: the ferments in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate, and in the reſt of the digeſtions. For this <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> moving <hi>ſine Motore alieno;</hi> ſets all the other wheels in motion, till being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antlated, and its vital power exhauſted, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Orbs forthwith ſubſiſt, are at a ſtand and fail. This <hi>Auto Kineton</hi> is the ſeat or ſubject of the ſenſitive ſoul, where it is emicant and tranſlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the ſame manner, as the beams of the Sun received in by the air in a ſerene, clear sky are effulgent and bright, but in a cloudy, dusky heaven are offuſcated and opacous. Needs muſt melancholly, ſad thoughts attend the mind, when the ſpirits are tenebrous, dim, and dark, being clouded and over-ſpread with dark, miſty fogs of noyſom, exhalations ariſing from impure, fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, malignant, degenerate moiſture, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſoul lodging therein to act irregularly, in as much as the primary inſtrument this vital ſteam by which the ſoul operates, is depraved
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108903:14"/> and bereaved of its genuine goodneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this place of the lifes reſidence may be capable to receive ſo divine a gueſt; Nature hath ordained and curiouſly fabricated ſeveral Pipes, venal, arterial and nervous, with fit cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and convenient parts adjoyning for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, Fermentation, Digeſtion, Exaltation, Purification of this vital juice: So that if any thing diſſonant, violent, adverſe, incongruous, and of a different Texture enter into it, the ſame is either forthwith exploded, or a great inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, diſplacency, and confuſion ariſeth in the Oeconomy of the body, to the hazard of the whole frame of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe if the ſtomach titubate and come ſhort in its right digeſtion, all the other ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng ſhops ordained for maturation and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this rubicund Liquor, cannot correct the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, errours, and defects of the firſt, ſo that we may conclude without controverſie, that this Noble Membranous cavity, layeth the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the further erection and ſuperſtructure of the prime matter, which makes this ſtately edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice entire and firm. Let not any harbour a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that the Liquor current in the veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries will ever be brought to that requiſite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and cleanſed from that droſs it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to, unleſs the ſtomach, the Key that unlocks all the Privy <hi>Chambers</hi> and <hi>Cloſets</hi> of this little world, be firſt ſet in order and rectifyed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis all one, as if one ſhould pump without ſtopping the leak, if he apply Remedies, <hi>à Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriori,</hi> to the conſequent indigencies in the parts, neglecting the main defect of the Duum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate, <hi>à priori,</hi> which like the Helme of a ſhip,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108903:14"/> reduces into the right channel, the aberrations of other Kitchins ordained for the formal alteration of nutriment. For this purpoſe our principal ſtudy ought to be employed about the ſearch of ſuch Remedies, that are amicable and delectable to the <hi>Archeus,</hi> corroborate the tone of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, augment, regulate, and fortifie its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſcoure away any thing recrementitious in it: dulcifie and mitigate what ere is acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, preter-naturally auſtere, acid, corroding, ſaline, or putride therein: This being duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Pyrotechnical Philoſopher, a ſure door is opened for the exemption of Nature, much oppreſſed from ſundry grievous Diſeaſes, (which otherwiſe would prove incurable) bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eluding all the trivial medicaments of the Galeniſts.</p>

                  <p>How inſenſibly do thoſe virulent peſtilential atoms fluctuating in the air cauſe a miaſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion in this red maſs, whereby it becoms coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or colliquated: which inconveniencies are no more to be avoided in ſome places, than that it is poſſible for any one to live without air. Doubtleſs that tedious Chronick diſeaſe the Scorbute, which is ſo predominant and Graſſant in this Nation, doth in greateſt part diffuſe it ſelf by means of the air, which inſenſibly conveys its pernicious Nature from Body to Body. So that ſome few having a high tincture of this evil, may in ſome ſhort ſpace, reſorting to much Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, annoy by a ſpreading ferment many hundreds, who according as their Bodies are diſpoſed and capable for the reception of this infectious Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſuffer more or leſs in pollution of this Nectar of life which by degrees falleth off from its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine goodneſs.

Infinite are the exhalations flowing out from all ſorts of Bodies, greedily ſucked up by the magnale or poroſities of the air, which, when, where, and how it affects the bloud is not eaſily known to us: only this we can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that we have received injury from this ſubtil ambient, that adheres as cloſe to us as we to place.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a common Opinion taken up frequently by the vulgar, when they are indiſpoſed or inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any diſeaſe, to ſay they have taken cold, thereby mincing and extenuating the magnitude and malignity of many feral Diſeaſes to their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal overthrow, being ſo taught by their Oracle like Galenical Doctors (as they fancy them) whom they obſerved to inſiſt upon bare Qualities (meerly tranſitory, momentany, and ſhadows of true ſubſtances) for the Cure of moſt deſperate Diſeaſes, eſpecially Fevers: which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is often produced, excited, and irritated by the ambient, but not meerly from the bare qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof quatenus cold, but as it is ſtuffed full of atoms Hoſtile to the Texture of our bloud, which ruſhing in through the more patulous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Body, or ſtealing in through the leſs viſible pores, do frequently alter, and contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate this Aetherial Liquor. 'Tis granted, that cold doth ſometimes accidentally put the Body much out of order, in as much as it ſtoppeth up the pores of the skin, in ſuch wiſe, that many noxious recrements are conſtringed within, to the depravation of the bloud, the impediment of its Circulation, and ſo to the great prejudice of the health, which otherwiſe having free vent, rid nature of a burdenſome clog, oftentimes preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it down either into dangerous or mortal Feavers.</p>

                  <p>The goodneſs or pravity of the Latex depends much upon the bloud as it is conſtituted, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is no eſſential part thereof, yet is it altered for better or worſe, according to the channels it paſſes through, the lodging it taketh up, and the condition of its aſſociate, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I will not deny but that it may be ſometimes impaired in its due excellency, and this withall remain very pure and ſincere.

                  <p>Urine and ſweat are by ſome reputed to be the ſame, however they are miſtaken, for urine comes from a putrefactive principle, whereby the Latex is turned into an urinous Nature by vertue of a ferment proper to the Kidneys, which if it be perverted, many Diſeaſes emerge, Dyſuria, Iſchuria, Stranguria: if totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed there happens, that rare affect called Diabetes.

                  <p>Here I cannot but make an animadverſion on that truculent Diſeaſe which formerly raged in <hi>England,</hi> to the deſtruction of ſome thouſands. It had its original doubtleſs from a degenerate Latex turned into a malignant <hi>Ichor,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a tabefaction or colliquation of the bloud and Nutritive juice, which iſſuing forth in a copious meaſure ſymptomatically, without any Euphoria alleviation, quickly conſumed the ſtock of life. The attempt made at firſt to cure this malady, by ſtopping the ſweat by aſtringents and cooling things, proved not only fruſtraneous, but alſo very mortal, for the malignity being thereby more concentrated, wanting a <hi>Momentaneous</hi> vent through the univerſal membrane, it forthwith preyed upon the <hi>Archeus,</hi> extinguiſhing the Lamp of life in ſuch ſort as a Mephitis or ſubterranean damp doth obſuſcate, and at length put out the flame of a Candle. Now the proper adaequate Remedies that took effect in this feral evil, were Euſtomachicks, as likewiſe counterpoyſons that did immediately reſiſt the venome by oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Idaea thereof, by corroborating the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normon, exterminating the intoxicated <hi>Ichor,</hi> and ill conditioned Latex through the habit of the body, carrying it that way <hi>quo natura vergere ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt ſtubborn Coughs oftentimes vex many, by reaſon this Latex is become illegitimate and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108903:21"/> deſtitute of its primary eucraſie: for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a ſubtile pungitive acrimony, itexceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieves the tender body of the Lungs, through which it is continually circulated. Hereby this part is extimulated to vexatious exploſion, night and day without any conſiderable expectoration. The Galenical Lohochs, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batives, ſyrups, and ſeveral mixtures ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this caſe, for they do but prejudice the Mint where the Latex doth firſt receive a ſtamp, which being at firſt defaced, can never after be repaired and brought to its perfect form. I have always found experimentally, that nothing is more prevalent to maſter the Orgaſmus and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cataract of this fretful Liquor, than to give a vomit proper for the diſcharging any ſuperfluity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtomach, no whit offenſive to its ferment, nor diminiſhing its vital ſtrength. As for thoſe vomits of the ſhops, which Galeniſts make uſe of, I utterly renounce them, as unfitting to be uſed by a true Son of Art.</p>
                  <p>Here I ſhall inſert ſomething requiſite, and peculiarly belonging to a vomit that acts as it ought towards the cure of any dangerous Diſeaſe. 1. It ought to be ſafe,—ſo that one need not fear to ſleep after it, to walk about the houſe, nor be terrified that it work not by vomit or ſtool. 2. It is aſſiſtant to Nature, that it may be able to diſcharge the morbifick matter, keeping up its vigour after a ſharp contention and victory over the Diſeaſe: not leaving it very languide in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be encountred by ſecond infirmities, as is commonly obſerved to be the effect of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Purgatives. 3. It leaves untouched what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſound, not coliquating the wholſome
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108903:22"/> juice of the parts. 4. It conveys away by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration ſweat, and urine, whatſoever is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile to Nature. 5. It ſweetens the Acrimony and Acidity of the Latex. 6.

That Phyſician that is furniſhed with ſuch an <hi>Arcanum,</hi> dares give a vomit to that Patient, to whom a Galeniſt of the greateſt fame dare not exhibit one (as I have heard) for a hundred pound. I have this twenty years practice attempted many ſpecious, highly applauded medicines, for the regulating this ſpurious Latex, but never was I ſucceſsful to any purpoſe, till by long labour and expences, I at length met with ſuch an Emetick, endued with the aforeſaid properties, which was potent in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the errours of this limpha in the fountain or firſt ſource thereof, I mean, the Duumvirate that governs the whole body.

For in truth, diſeaſes generally are firſt embryonated and Characterized in the vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, reſiding in the <hi>Hypochondries,</hi> ſtomach, and ſpleen, from whence they are traduced ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily into other parts. For example, <hi>Cephalaea,</hi> i. e. an inveterate pain in the Head, took its firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the enormon of the <hi>Duumvirate,</hi> where the ſeminal Rudiments and Idaea of this diſeaſe were obumbrated or ſhadowed forth by the ſenſitive ſoul, excited to paſſion upon the apprehenſion of ſomething diſagreeing and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to vitality. Afterward the ſame is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delineated in the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the brain, in which the ſcene laid below is now brought to light above. Now is to be ſeen a ſyndrom of many ſymptoms, which plainly ſhew the Nature of the diſeaſe ſuitable to the part afflicted: here the Latex and vital juice apoſtatize by degrees from their purity the ferments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the digeſtions of the brain becomming viciated, ſo that this Organ which at firſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

Now the efficient and material cauſe of all diſeaſes, is the vital ſpirit implanted, eſpecially in the moſt pure juice contained, and parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, for the ſupply of which the influent ſerves.

                  <p>As the ſoul inhabits the <hi>Archeus,</hi> ſo this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in the blood, and all three take up for their Metropolitan or chief place of Reſidence the ſtomach and ſpleen, in which the ſoul by means of the <hi>Duumvirate</hi> acts freely.

Sith then it is otherwiſe, that the ſymptoms of the falling ſickneſs, Lethargy, Peripneumone, Aſthma, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do conſtantly evidently diſcover the ſpecies and eſſence of the Diſeaſe; this can never be but from an efficient material cauſe or Principle above the four humours of the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, or the three principles of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and his Sectary Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> who adds to <hi>Sal,</hi> ſul. and ☿, Water and Earth. But how far from ſolid truth, we ſhall ere long examine.</p>
                  <p>As for the former opinion, it is at this day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by moſt Scient Philoſophers, who have rejected that conſuming <hi>Ens</hi> (which they would have to make up one of their four Elements, and conſequently the four humors, as a meer fictitious conceit, fetched from the <hi>Utopian</hi> Elemental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of fire immediately next the Moon.</p>
                  <p>This latter opinion borrowed from the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, I confeſs ſeems to be plauſible and very taking, as if it contained ſome verity: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding narrowly ſearched into, and put to the fiery tryal of experimental Philoſophy, the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>Lapis Lydius</hi> or touch-ſtone of our Works, whetner they be allowed or Reprobate, it will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108903:24"/> appear expreſly, that thoſe ſo called five Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principles, of which all bodies (as Dr. <hi>Will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> aſſerts) have their initiated Syntheſis, Cuncreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Compoſition, and into which their Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Diſſolution is made, are not the eſſential, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and materil cauſe of diſeaſes. I cannot ſubſcribe to what Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> poſitively delivers as a truth, <hi>in capii de ferment,</hi> that <hi>Corpora quaevis è Spiritu, Sulphure, Sale, Aqua &amp; Terra conſtare,</hi> i. e. Every body conſiſts of Spirit, Salt, Sulphur, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Earth, and according as is the different motion and meaſure of theſe in Concretes, ſo is the beginning and end of every thing, with the diverſity of their fermentations to be conſidered. I would willingly know of Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> as expert an Anatomiſt, as he is in the diſſection of Nature, when ever he diſcovered viſibly all theſe five principles in any body whatſoever, without the torture and corruption of the whole.</p>
                  <p>If theſe can be otherwiſe extracted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to me by him, I ſhall become more inclinable to his opinion: but ſith I am ſure he cannot, I have very good reaſon to maintain, that theſe parts ſeparated from Bodies by the fire, were never actually pre-exiſtent in them, but are fabricated by Vulcan, and ſo inſtead of being Principles or Elements of things, they become no other than Products. Moreover if ever the Doctor beheld with his eyes, ſhewing to us the ſame (for to putatitious notions of the Brain we give no credit, ſith being an experimental Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, we hope he will not impoſe any thing upon us barely, becauſe he ſaith it) theſe five ſuppoſed fundamental Principles produced in any living body by any heat whatſoever, I ſhall forthwith
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108903:25"/> ſubmit to his judgment, and Cure diſeaſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Hypotheſis. Till then he muſt excuſe me, if I tell him that the ſtately touring ſtructure founded upon this Quinary Doctrine of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, eaſily captivating thoſe that look only ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially upon truth, will undoubted fall to Ruine. 2. Theſe ſuppoſed <hi>quinta prima,</hi> cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated from ſome bodies by the fire, any Art or ſublunary machine of man, witneſs Mercury, which being a Homogeneous, ſimilar, <hi>Ens,</hi> (not conſpurcated or fouled with any ſtrange matter) cannot by any deviſe of man whatſoever be brought into the foreſaid parts. It may indeed be diſguiſed ſeveral ways by additaments, deluding the eye in the form of an Oil, Water, Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and Earth, but they are only momentany dreſſes, which this Proteus hath aſſumed no whit Real, ſith it may in a ſhort time be made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocede to its primitive <hi>Individual Subſtance and Conſiſtence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our great Philoſopher <hi>Heimont,</hi> declares abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>Ex Arena ſilicibus ſaxis non calcariis ſul. aut</hi> ☿ <hi>nunquam trahi poſſe:</hi> That 'tis impoſſible to fetch out of Sand Flints, and all ſort of ſtones except Lime ſtones, Sulphur, or Mercury. But he could by means of his Liquor Alkaheſt (never to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> or any Galeno-Chymiſt, who dare not believe it hath an exiſtence, leaſt it ſhould be expected they ſhould ſpare time, take pains, and be at Charges to acquire it) he was able I ſay by means of this great Diſſolvent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Sand, or Stone, into ſalt aequiponderat to its former Bulk, which mechanical Probation gives more ſatisfaction to any intelligent Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this truth, than any tedious Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108903:25"/> to the contrary, contrived never ſo ſubtilly and plauſibly.</p>
                  <p>Again, what ſpagyrical hand did ever Analyſe Water (not impregnated with a ſeed) that the <hi>Quinta Prima</hi> might be made manifeſt. The <hi>Tria Prima</hi> according to our Philoſopher, may be ſaid to be in it Analogicôs, but in no wiſe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſtent therein. 'Tis true, we often uſe the Etymon of 3 <hi>Prima,</hi> for the diſtinction of thoſe parts that have a diſparity in them created by the fire, yet this doth not conclude that they had their integral being in that body, out of which they were extorted anamolôs. No more than a Charcoal can be ſaid to be <hi>revera</hi> in Wood, Glaſs in aſhes or ſand: becauſe by the Alterative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Vulcan, they have received this peculiar ſtamp differing from the quiddity of the thing they were before. <hi>Helmont</hi> affirms an <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> may be drawn out of any Vegetable that hath not lignofity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The ſame water alſo that nouriſheth ſundry Plants of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind, ſhould harbour in it ſo many ſorts of ſpecifick juices fitting for the nouriſhment and accretion of each diſtinct Vegetable. But this is ridiculous to conceive, ſith we cannot but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108903:26"/> know that the ſeminal ferments of every thing maketh a tranſmutation of what it taketh in, and by vertue of them, alters, appropriates, and brings into an Identity with it ſelf, that which before was remote of another kind, and moving in another ſphear. This formal tranſmutation is frequently practiced by Nature: the Rain firſt exhaled from infinite number of bodies, carryed up into the middle Region, where the ſeed of every thing is mortifyed, is there converted into water, which being ingravidated with celeſtial vertues, is by their influence forced to deſcend upon the Earth, in whoſe matrice it acquires a prolifick ferment, to which a <hi>Plaſtick-spirit</hi> is forthwith invited to take up its lodging, being alſo excited to frame an Idaea of that Vegetable <hi>Ens</hi> which it intends to produce: ſo falling to work, and pourtraying the figure of the whole, from an inviſible principle it becomes by degrees manifeſt, bringing to perfection at length every part of the Plant, that was before limmed in its imagination. This being devoured by a Sheep, or Ox, is altered by the ſpecifick ferment of the ſtomach, changing it into an acid Chyle or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my juice, that paſſing into the Guts becomes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line by vertue of that viſcus vitale the Gaul: The purer part of this juice receiving now a previous diſpoſition for ſeparation, is ſucked up by thoſe veſſels they call Milky which convey it into the veins, where intermingled with the ruddy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, it is called <hi>Cruor,</hi> afterward being circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome conſiderable time, it's made by the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting efficacy of the bloud and bowels fit for nutrition, accretion, and generation. This Beaſt feeding conſtantly upon this vegetable, is at lenght
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108903:26"/> impinguated, and made food for man, who eating thereof, tranſmutes this fleſh into Chyle, Chyme, and Cruor; at length having paſſed through the firſt Kitchin and five ſeveral fermental operations, it is identifyed and individuated with the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fleſh of man. This man is devoured by a Shark or the like fiſh, and paſſes through all that formal Metamorphôſis, which this fiſh makes in thoſe ſeveral places of Cookery and digeſtion, at laſt from mans fleſh it attains to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Behold what a verſatile Scene of Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is here repreſented to our eyes, ariſing firſt from ſimple water, which entering upon the ſtage of the Earth ſtarts up, ſhewing it ſelf in diverſe ſhapes, according as the coercive ſeminal fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments attire it. In this caſe ſure no Philoſopher in his right wits will affirm that there is ſo many principles couched in the Water, as there are formal Tranſmutations of things ariſing from the ſame. He will rather forthwith underſtand op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, having made ſome ſerious Analyſis of Bodies, and obſerved a tendency in them to their prme initiation Water, that Heterogeneities and diſtinct Phaenomena of ſubſtances in the Plant, Brute, Man, and Fiſh, and Man again, are but the fruits of topical and acquired ferments, actuated by a ſeminal <hi>Archeus;</hi> that Water alſo is the firſt foundation on which the manifold ſtories of ſo many <hi>Entia,</hi> diſcrepating in form are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which being ruinated, return into the ſame again. I could enlarge my ſelf on this ſubject,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108903:27"/> according to the various Experiments and Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have ſeen, but I muſt contract, ſtudying conciſeneſs in whatſoever I deliver. 3. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and viciſſitude of theſe ſuppoſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, powerfully refute them to be what he would have them: for according to <hi>Ariſtole, Initia debent eſſe ſtabilia,</hi> whatſoever are properly denominated principles, are to remain conſtant, and no ways alterable one into another: now the contrary is found in theſe, foraſmuch as they may by Art (which I am ſure I can perform) be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally converted one into another, as Sulphur into Salt, ſalt into ſpirit, ſpirit into water, again ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into ſalt, ſalt into ſulphur, and ſulphur into Water and Earth.

They do not truly underſtand the energy of Zymôſis, what a powerful alterity is made by it, and how the ſulphureous particles of the vegetable becomes urinous like the ſpirit of the animal, whereby it is enabled to profligate the morbifick matter, through all the Emmunctories, ſluces, and ſecret paſſages of the body. This really is the direct way of curing feavers fundamentally, not ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cooling Julips, Barley Water, Poſſet-drink made with ſmall Beer, leaſt it ſhould be too hot, prone to make the ſulphur in the bloud as they alledge incenſed already, to become more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly head-ſtrong no wayes to be reined or governed by the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

In this ſtate an appropriated Emetick (I mean not the common vomits) is of great force to break the ice for a future Cure. This I adviſe to be repeated two or three times, if the patient be in a capable condition to receive any benefit, yea when the ſtomach is ſometimes dull, beſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or imbrued with viſcous, tenacious phlegm, wanting ſomething to extimulate, attenuate, and ſubtiliate this groſs ſubſtance, incruſtating as it were the inward Coat, then have I found by ſtrict obſervation, that ſuch a gentle Emeto-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick, which if it excite not this tender mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane neither by vomit nor ſtool, will carry off any Scoria through the eccentrical parts or uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Pipes in no wiſe impairing the ſtrength no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.

                  <p>Now am I ready to diſcover in reference to the Cure of miſerable man: that the pretended ſanguine ſulphur or Cacochymy of any in a high feaver doth afford more ſalt, water and earth each of them than ſulphur.

                     </gap>, Moderation in all things is a moſt excellent compaſs to ſteer by.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not the quality of what we aſſume, as the quantity that is injurious to us: For I am of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> his mind, who adviſes a healthful man to eat any thing, that his ſtomach can well alter. If he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108903:35"/> commit an errour in eating or drinking a little too much at one time, let him uſe abſtinence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward for the correction of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved of late years a great proneneſs in the bloud to be ſoil'd and conſpurcated in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, by reaſon of a great Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical malignity lurking in the body, the Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick cauſe of which may very juſtly be deduced from our prodigious Luſts, our enormous Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in compotations. I am eaſily perſwaded, that the Venereal Lues at firſt procreated this ſpurious Brat, whoſe Heteroclite and diſcrepant exiſtence from other diſeaſes, doth plainly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that an anomalous ſeed ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of two evils differing in ſpecie, brought forth this horrid Monſter to light, being ſince propagated and traduced from one to another, ſpreading like a Leproſie over the whole Nation, by reaſon of a Clandeſtine miaſm, or infection that neſtles within, whoſe ſubtil Aporrhaeas or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations diffuſe themſelves in ſuch contagious manner, that moſt of the Nation are thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me very diſſentaneous to truth what Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> alleges to be the fomenter of this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitousevil among us, condemning the frequent uſe of Sugar, and his reaſon is, that this matter being put to the proof of the fire (a ſpagyrical Analyſis made thereof) affords a Liquor but little leſs corroſive than <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> as if the ferment of the ſtomach did diſſolve in the ſame manner as the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution made byart, or that ſuch a acid matter were really contained in the Concrete, which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108903:36"/> forth a moſt naſty empyrematical Liquor: ſhall we therefore refuſe ſuch wholſome Aliment? withall let him be pleaſed to take notice, that the effects of the fire are Aequivocal, various, and mutable according as the matter diſtilled receives ſuch or ſuch an Adjunct; for I can by vertue of Vulcans Art make the whole body of the better ſort of Sugar (adding ſomething to it congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or of like kind) become excellently medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal for the Cure of the Scurvy above all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries preparations, the Doctor makes uſe of: This I can demonſtrate, moreover I know no reaſon that a ſubſtance ſo pleaſant to the taſte of moſt as it were a ſweet Alkali, ſo uſeful for preſervation and mundification of what is foul and prone to corrupt, ſhould be rejected guilty of ſo high a Crime as to promote the Scurvy moſt infamouſly. For ſatisfaction of thoſe that are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in this thing, I dare undertake to keep half a ſcore or more perſons drinking liberally every day Beer and Sugar, yea eating Sugar with meat plentifully, (as I knew a Galenical Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of great renown allow of as very wholſom) freer from the Scurvy than any Dogmatiſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhall perform with all his Art exerciſed on the ſame number, debaring them this delicious congeled ſalt Under favour of better judgments (if I may deliver what I have obſerved without offence,) I conceive our Sybaritical voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ebriety, mangonical, pampering ſauces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as a ſhooing horn to the exciting the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to the drawing in a greater quantity and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of food then Nature can well digeſt, is an extraordinary procurer of this grand malady graſſant among us. Above all, I much condemn the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108903:36"/> common abuſe of Tobacco, out of which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes than a Scorbutical venom is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally ſucked. Agreeable to which judgment of mine is that of the Legitimate Artiſt Dr. <hi>Mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi> who marks where Tobacco is much taken, the Scurvy doth moſt abound. I wiſh thoſe who are too forward to condemn Chymical prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ordered by true Philoſophers, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon themſelves and others as yet ignorant of Pyrotomy, how that they are too forward in ruſhing into this Science: indirectly making uſe of a Retort with a receiver, I mean, a Pipe and the mouth for the reduction of this Plant into ſalt and ſulphur, proving not a little injurious to them. If they were conſcious how ſubtle an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my it is, how hardly to be dealt withall in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſenſe, how inſinuating, tempting, delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; how diſagreeing to Nature, as is manifeſt at firſt taking it, pretending an evacuation only of a ſuperfluous moiſture when it alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſame; how it wrongs the Ventricle by reaſon of a continuity of its membrane with that of the mouth; how it taints the nutricious juice; how it Dozes the brain, impairing its faculties eſpecially the Memory, they would quickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this herb to the hand of thoſe that know what belongs to the right management and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:108903:37"/>
                  <p>I am not ignorant what ſome object, that there are thoſe who taking an extraordinary quantity of Tobacco have lived to a great age, as 60, or 70, years. 2. That multitudes not taking this fume are yet notwithſtanding overun with the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. 3. That ſome have proteſted they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved certain benefit by this Plant, when other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies preſcribed by able Phyſicians have been invalid to relieve them. 4. That there are places where Man, Woman, and Child, take in this ſmoak, none of theſe ſad effects appearing.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt I anſwer, one Swallow makes no Sommer, I reckon this among <hi>raro contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> I have known one very intemperate in Diet live to the fore-mentioned age: but doubtleſs, had he regulated himſelf according to the Rules of Mediocrity, he might have doubled that age. Innate ſtrength of body, doth carry a man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through that without any great dammage, which deſtroys another.</p>
                  <p>2. I do not affirm that this vegetable is the ſole coajduvant cauſe of the Scurvy, it being certain there are many promoters thereof. Beſides, yet granted that your great Compotators <hi>Ventricolae,</hi> Gormandizers, (who have as the Grecians, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, Lazy Panches, little elſe to do but to take Tobacco to paſs away the time, filling pipe after pipe, as faſt as poſſibly they can exhauſt it) are commonly incrdent to this feral malady. Hereupon this very ſame ſpecifick diſeaſe may be diffuſed and communicated to others by e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108903:37"/> the Husband be free if the Wife be vexed. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſome Peoples breath doth exceedingly taint the air, to the great annoyance of others.</p>
                  <p>3. I condemn not medicinal appropriation and application of this Drug, for I know it to be of excellent vertue: there is great difference, <hi>inter dictum ſecundum quid &amp; dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cenſure of any thing as abſolutely evil, and the indirect practice of it. Moreover, what is one mans meat, may be anothers poiſon.</p>
                  <p>4. The generality of ſmoaking it in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without thoſe ill effects we find, doth not at all fruſtrate my aſſertion: for I have obſerved a more moderate courſe of life in Diet, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the air, with an Hereditary cuſtom, hath in great meaſure ballanced the nocument or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, which otherwiſe they would have contracted by exceſs thereof; neither are theſe numerous Tobacconiſts acquitted from this evil, as it appears by thoſe frequent eruptions in the skin, whereby a greater miſchief is prevented within, they being only effloreſcences of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical pravity.</p>
                  <p>There are as I apprehend two principal reaſons to be given why this Weed hath captivated ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in ſuch ſort, that they become meer ſlaves to it.</p>
                  <p>One is the ſeeming delight it affords in the preſent taking thereof, inducing a pleaſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching melancholly, exceedingly affecting their fancies, ſo that they could wiſh with him in the Poet: <hi>Hic furor O Superi, fit mihi perpetuus,</hi> O that I might always thus melanchollize, not conſidering though the Prologue be chearful, the Epilogue is often ſad; though the ſpirits are as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108903:38"/> it were titillated and charmed into a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency for a ſhort ſpace, yet afterward a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gloomineſs ſeizes upon them. Indeed how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing they are but forcibly lulled into this ſecure placid condition, by that which is as far remote from the vitals, as the beams of the Sun are from a black cloud.</p>
                  <p>I find in this ſmoak a ſtinking, retunding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſing <hi>Opiate like</hi> ſulphur, and an acrid ſalt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, extimulating, ſo that by the bridling much of the one, and the exceſſive ſpurring of the other, the ſpirits like a free metalſome horſe, are quite tired out at laſt. It is impoſſible that the frequent inſinuations of this ſubtil fume ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhew of affinity, but quite of another tribe with the animals ſhould not at length (let a body be never ſo ſtrong and cuſtom how ever preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) either pervert or ſubvert his well conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted frame.</p>

Not finding the leaſt fault with the extravagant uſe of Tobacco, which above all did them the moſt hurt privately. Something I can ſpeak experimentally to this purpoſe, for having been wedded to it many years paſt, ſuppoſing I had got an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hypochondriack melancholly, with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophlegmatiſm, to diſcharge crude matter, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded it in all Company without advertency at that time, how falſe and treacherous it was, which afterward perceiving, I withdrew my ſelf from the uſe thereof by degrees, at length was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divorced from it.</p>

I would willingly be reſolved concerning ſome Queſtions I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our great Phlebotomiſt. 1. Whether he can make an election of ſuch a veſſel for aperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108903:51"/> wherein the fouleſt juice is contained. 2. Whether this ſeeming to the eye foul or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt may deſerve this Epithete, or may not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſomething that is very uſeful to Nature: ſith Chymiſts take notice of a ſtrange diſguiſe put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things, making them ſeem to be what they are not really.) 3. Whether this frequent emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a leſſer Quantity, conſidering the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Corroboratives exhibited by Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, will excuſe the ill effect of this operation. 4. Whether a ſucceſſion of a new ſupply for what is evacuated, will produce any conſiderable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration in it, according to our Authors aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 5. What Experiments the Doctor will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to teſtifie unto us, that Phlebotomy is a way equivalent with the beſt Remedies to amend Scorbutical bloud.</p>
                  <p>That this Ruddy juice is better or worſe in ſome venal pipes above other, is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any who hath been Spectator when it ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out: but how this is to be diſcerned within the veſſels, I underſtand not unleſs a man had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, <hi>intus &amp; in Cute,</hi> could intuitively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold where it lies, and ſo accordingly let out the worſe, leaving the beſt. I have marked in my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority a laudable ſanguineous juice to come firſt out of the ſame vein, then afterwards more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible: in others the contrary. One time I have ſeen it extracted inculpable, a few hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vitiated, inſomuch the Phyſician and Patient have been ſorry for the loſs of that, and glad at the riddance of this. Yea Learned men have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſick perſons to have a vein portunded, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this Reaſon, that they verily apprehended a cacochymie within, whereas upon tryal no ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108903:52"/> matter afterward appeared, to the diſparagement of the Art, and debility of the Patient. Seeing then one is at no certainty this way to have what is depraved taken from him, yea in danger to looſe what is Euchymous: Me thinks this inciſion of a vein for the Cure of a Scorbutical impurity ſhould not be ſo ſtifly inſiſted upon by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, ſeeing he may as wel miſs as hit the ſcope.</p>
                  <p>2. 'Tis commonly pronounced by the Chirurgeous, and approved by their Maſters when the bloud altered by the ambient, looks with any deformed aſpect, as Green, Yellow, White, or Blackiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that 'tis happy this was taken away, ſuppoſed to be the only ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein a Feaver, Scorbute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rooſted, to which the credulous Patient is ſorthwith prone to aſſent, being fully perſwaded by his miſerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful auxiliators, that ſo much of his infirmity is abtruncated or diſmembred, as there is bad bloud extramitted. This often lures him to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third evacuation.</p>
                  <p>But how inconſiderately this is done, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul cries of Widows and Orphans do too often proclaim; for this very bloud which they decry, rejecting it as very bad and corrupt in the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringer, was running in the veins free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, containing parts very uſeful to nature, which might by the activity of powerful Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be as eaſily reduced to its native goodneſs, as Mercury aſſuming the Vizard of ſalt, ſulphur, water, ſublimate, precipitate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may eaſily by means of fixed Alkalies and Vulnerarie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes be brought home to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſuppoſed Phaenomena of ſal. ſul. water, earth, are but ſeparations made by a poſterous corruption of the bloud, excited thereto by the

                  <p>For he conceives it will come all to one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, to exhauſt them by little and little, ſeveral times repeated, as to draw out the ſame meaſure at once, being aſſured that the end which he aims at will never be attained by this courſe. Now I find our Phlebotomiſt conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the Scorbute ſtrangely ſeizes upon the vitals, debilitating them in an anomalous manner injoyns reiterations of a parcimonious bleeding leaſt the patient ſhould be too viſibly damnifyed in his ſtrength (the cuſtody of which ſhould tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend

Wherefore the ſum is this, rather than this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary depletion ſhall fall to ground to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of their Galenick method, it ſhall be preſcribed in ſuch a moderate portion, that the ignorant, ſick perſon ſhall never diſcover the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture thereof: ſo that if through innate ſtrength and ſome accidental means otherwiſe he find a relevation, Phlebotomy ſhall forth with carry the credit thereof; if he be pejorated and thrown into a worſe condition, hereby afterward though not for the preſent, this irregular way is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and all muſt fall upon the pertinacous infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Now 'tis plain, they will play at ſmall Games rather than ſtand out: Be doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this way either to little purpoſe, or little hurt; for if there be detriment in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter portion, it cannot otherwiſe be according to the doctrine of the mathematicks, but there ſhould needs be ſome prejudice in a leſſer, though not ſo ſenſible.

In this caſe I adviſed him contrary to his expectation, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear bleeding, which courſe ſome of his friends advertiſed him before-hand what Phyſician ſoever he made uſe of would take. Withall I told him, if he would be ruled by me, I could promiſe to relieve him in two or three hours, which he willingly liſtned to: forthwith ſwallowing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

For all this I foretold him a Viper lay in the graſs unſeen, declaring in expreſs terms, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom he harboured within muſt either be driven out in the form of pimples, ſports, or red Blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: otherwiſe all the art of man could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, which according thereto fell out in part, the next morning after a troubleſome night.</p>
                  <p>Now for the farther promotion of nature in her work: I gave him on the day following another Emeto-Cathar. with a Diaphor. which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very well in carrying off morbifick matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, pulling up ſome of the roots thereof about the ſtomach and ſpleen.</p>
                  <p>After which, I followed him cloſe with the highly exalted ſulphurs of certain minerals. He took alſo liberally of thoſe Volatiles moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the vitals? Theſe pacifyed the rage of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> encouraging and joyning ſorces with it againſt a domeſtick enemy, ſweetned in ſome meaſure the acidity of the Latex, carrying it off by large profuſion of univerſal ſweats, bringing to the ſuperficies of his body (in ſuch a manner as I predicted) that malignant bloud which lay lurking nigh the center of life: ſo that my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was exceeding well perſwaded of me for the proſpect I had of what hitherto fell out.

All things being upon the fourth day from my firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit in a happy condition, my patient being free from anyeminent danger of miſcarrying as I often intonated in their ears. Some of the inconſtant vulgar about him (prejudiced againſt this Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way that it was too violent and hot) affrighted at every intenſe motion of the <hi>Archeus</hi> (invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by active medicines to profligate whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is hoſtle) were very buſie in prompting to the ſick man the worſe, repreſenting every thing in the moſt deformed dreſs, enough to make him deſpond to the poſtergation of the Cure.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon another Phyſician, a Kinſman of the Merchants formerly a great Philo-chymiſt before he entred into the colledge, was by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent admitted to conſultation, who approved of all I had done hitherto, neither could he deny but that my Remedies were ſufficient, yet being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the right uſe of them, adviſed me to give not above the tenth part of what I exhibited, however leaſt he ſhould viſit for nought, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, one Mr. <hi>Batteſbee</hi> was forthwith ſent for, who I knew would ſoon diſturb my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>

Now a ſubtil Trade is carryed on, they aim at the lopping off the branches: I at the pulling up of the root. So at length we begin to jar after a former har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for as ſoon as another opportunity was offered to me, on the fifth day I gave him the third Emeto-Cathartick for more ſecurity, which he willingly accepted ſtill finding it beneficial, much, confiding in me for my pre-monitions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was encompaſſed with thoſe that were very diffidently adverſe to my Remedies.

Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what errours were paſt, for which he might thank himſelf, I told him, I doubted not to cure his Ague, and take away the Haemorroidal anguiſh radically, if he would be obliged now at length to take what ere I gave without ſcruple; he conſented in great part thereto excepting vomits <hi>i. e.</hi> Galenical, with which he affirm'd he was tir'd: It was diſpenſed with, &amp; his Ague in a ſhort time cured with certain Pills I call Polychreſt, with other ſlight things; yet ſtill the Haemorroides tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him.

In ſickneſs becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant, ſending out a vicious juice into all parts, be it good or bad, it ſtill ſprings from a Root which continually feeds the branches: ſo that it cannot be other than great folly and wrong to the Patient, to let out that juice, though it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108903:63"/> ſeem never ſo corrupt, when another of the like condition muſt needs enter into its place, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that ſhop the <hi>Duumvirate,</hi> where it firſt receives a previous Rudiment, which ought in all reaſon rather to be reformed, than to give vent to thoſe eaſily evanid particles inſeparably joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this ruddy Liquor, how ill ſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. If all contained in the veins (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be corrupt) were diſcharged, yet as long as the ferments principally of the firſt and ſixth digeſtion deviate from their right ſcope, there would in ſhort ſpace be a ſuccedaneous repletion of a matter equally contemptible, yea, worſe in reſpect of an enervation of ſtrength than before. But ſith a total riddance of this foul gueſt can hardly be made by Art in a very Cachochymick body without hazarding the life, there being a kind of neceſſity to leave ſome behind: no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is there an acceſſion of any approved every way compleated Chyme, but it is forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorated and infected by the contact of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que of that filthy reprobate Gore, which ſtill harbours in the veſſels wherein is a peccant fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment endangering as long as it continues the fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the whole maſs, a little Leaven leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole lump. Wherefore in my judgment, with humble ſubmiſſion to better reaſons the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is much out of the way in taking this courſe of mutilating and impoveriſhing the vitals, the preſervation of which tranſcends all other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations whatſoever, conſidering no ſolid benefit accrues thereby, withall weighing how the cauſe of moſt calamities, as the Scurvy, venereal Lues have their riſe from a venomous ſeed ingrafted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Hypochondries: for the abortion or

In brief, the true method is to ſcour every way by proper Mediums, the filth or feculency gathered together in the firſt foundation, deſtroying likewiſe the venom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the errour of the parts to their due Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praxie, corroborating them: then need we not doubt whatſoever is ſuperſtructed will quickly be brought to a handſome conformity, whereby this ſtately ſtructure may be kept <hi>Sarta tecta,</hi> in good reparations many years.</p>

                  <p>Herein I acquired after ſome labour, a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory notion of things, with a ſweet content, far ſurpaſſing any Pecuniary Reward: ſo that I could at length after a ſerious libration of the ſymptoms, undertake a Cure with confidence, ſucceeding proſperouſly therein. Aſſuredly this great Defender of bleeding ſhall find me no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now than formerly, as it were <hi>Raſa Tabula,</hi>

This I confeſs would ſeem plauſible were the matter in controverſie meerly Dogmatical putatitious, conſiſting in the rational conceptions of the brain. But ſith it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the concluſion of fact, certainly we are not ſo encloſed with the darkneſs of miſ-apprehenſions, or wildred in the Labyrinth of vain conceits, but we may by the conducting thread of infallible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments diſcoverable by our ſenſes get out, though not at the fore-door, yet at the back-door.

                  <p>Now this Controverſie between us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleeding can either be concluſively reſolved by equal experiments, or it cannot.

If it can, as I doubt not, let us put an end to this Debate, and let him that ſhrinks pretending this or that evaſion, be looked upon as one guilty of his own inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which ought in all Reaſon to oblige him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſpeak or Act contrary to the teſtimonies

                  <p>I have in Galenopale propoſed ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable truths for the deciſion of the different proceſſes of a Galenift &amp; Helmontian in Phyſick, but they have been ſo far from being accepted, that inſtead thereof, a ſcurrilous Piece full of untruths was publiſhed by one who did not dare to own it.

                  <p>Worthy Sir, I expect more handſome candid dealings from you, being perſwaded that you are ſo far a hearty lover of truth, that you ſcorn to be diſpleaſed with any one who ſhall offer any probable means for the indagation thereof. If thoughts ſhould ariſe in your breaſt that I have a meer deſign to eclipſe your Luſtre in the World, that I may be the more conſpicuous, I aſſure you are much miſtaken therein: For were it not for the promotion of fundamental Phyſical veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I ſhould hate to ſet Pen to Paper in deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any mans fame and Repute, for the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my own. So deſirous am I to know ſomething ſolidly uſeful in my Art, whereby my collapſed diſtreſſed Neighbour may be edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I ſhould think my ſelf happy to be your Diſciple upon ſuch terms. Be confident Sir, if I be not exaſperated through indignities, you ſhall never have cauſe to find fault with my Morality as it reſpects you, with whom I ſhould think my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108903:68"/> ſelf happy to joyn for the Reſtauration in part of the ſplendour of that profeſſion, which at this day is deplorably obſcured.</p>
                  <p>For that end, let us manifeſt to the world by each others actions, that there is a manner and means of healing, beyond the Plebian Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean or Pſeudo-Chymical reach, never to be attained but by a compleat Philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>Let us then in a friendly geſture meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon thoſe Perquiſites which may give us both content if we be ſincere <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>You and I, or ſo many of us on each ſide (as we ſhall agree upon) will viſit the ſick people of ſome Hoſpital, with equal and competent Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Cenſors: after that each party hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his verdict or opinion of the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe inward or outward, we will make our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction what is like to be the Epilogue or Event thereof, whether it be curable or no, and in what time probably it may be brought to paſs: let the Galeniſt or Helmontian, that (according to the ſentence of thoſe elected perſons to whoſe Award we are to ſtand) performs his buſineſs beſt in the Diagnoſtick, Prognoſtick, and Therapeutick part, prevail, and be taken into favour and tuition of the Magiſtrate; but let the other be rejected.</p>
                  <p>Or we will deal in this manner, we will ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſo many Patients afflicted with feavers or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes in the City whom we will viſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So according to our former propoſition, we will enter upon a direct proof, who may beſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108903:69"/> deſerve a Diplôma or Patent. Or we will (if you pleaſe) act ſeverally. We will (with ſo many impartial Judges) undertake twenty perſons vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Acute diſeaſes, and ſo many Chronick; after that we have illuſtrated the Nature, Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Magnitude of the diſeaſe to the ſtanders by (our aforeſaid Arbitrators) we will enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cure with a prognoſtick in acute diſeaſes after our firſt admiſſion, upon the fifth or ſixth day. In Chronick, in the ſpace of three weeks or a month at fartheſt: ye ſhall be bound to act the like, the ſame ſuperviſors attending you that did us; who after they have ſeriouſly weighed all circumſtances being rightly informed, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what difficulties both parties have been put upon, ſhall determine (as each of us have done better or worſe) who are the beſt Artiſts, and ſo receive a Reward or Mulet.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we declare that we ſhall take into our hands twenty ſick perſons troubled with acute feavers of what kind ſoever. Of theſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we will engage to ſecure (under God) ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of them upon the fifth or ſixth day after our approach, or to give a Prognoſtick upon the ſame days, how the diſeaſe will terminate; in which if we fail, we ſhall be willing to ſuffer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſuppoſed that ye come to the like trial.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ye inſiſt ſo much upon bleeding in a Pleuriſie, we dare oblige our ſelves to cure more Pleuritick perſons, <hi>Citò Tutò &amp; jucunde,</hi> without Phlebotomie, than ye ſhall making uſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fair equal proofs formerly propoſed, though ſomewhat oblique to our preſent matter

                  <p>We will ſearch out ten or twenty perſons over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with the Scurvy, whoſe blouds are certainly preſumed to be foul by apparent ſymptoms, let them be divided <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>When any ſick perſon is tired out ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths by ſanguimiſſion and a tedious courſe of phyſick, ſo that the Galeno-Chymiſt is at a ſtand whether he will live or die: then ſuffer us to ſpeak and act ſomething in this caſe for the credit of this Science.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:108903:70"/>
                  <p>We will alſo try who is beſt able to preſerve any one Scorbutical (whoſe bloud is conſpurca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) from a feaver, or when fallen into a feaver from the Scurvy, for 'tis certain they are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally incident one into the other.</p>
                  <p>He that ſuffers one afflicted with a feaver to fall into any long maladies or a relapſe, ſhall be eſteemed (if the Patient be conformable to his Rules) inſufficient in his faculty, and ſhall forfeit twenty pound; for as meanly as our adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eſteems us, we ſhall be willing to wage with them a conſiderable ſum of money upon every experiment.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as ſome who have the Scurvy much radicated in them, are cruciated with long, foul cacoethick ſoars depending upon an inquinated bloudy juice, an eſſay ſhall be made whether the true Philoſophical Spagyriſt or Galeno-Chymiſt are beſt able to heal the Ulcers fontally, ſpeedily, ſecurely, without danger of lapſe into a worſe calamity or recidivation into the like.</p>
                  <p>Many more Apodeictical Proceſſes could I ſtart of great validity to convince all aſpiring ſouls, thirſting to know verity of things from their effects, that there is a way to preſerve in ſanity, and recover in infirmity the frail Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> without this never-intended or allowed of (by the God of unity) courſe of making ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of contenuity in the skin, for the letting out the Balſom of life, but I ſhall requeſt our famous propugnator of Phlebotomy to ſet his Ingenie on work to find out more experimental proofs (not excluding the reaſon of the natural cauſes of what we practice) for the ultimate diſcuſſion of this debate, which is the principal partition-wall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108903:71"/> that keeps us aſunder. Aſſuredly there ſhall be no man breathing more tractable &amp; condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than my ſelf, to accept of any offers tending to the putting a period to all altercations of this kind for the future.</p>
                  <p>Thus much by way of confutation of ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as it is indicated by the pravity or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the bloud.

                  <p>'Tis certainly known to thoſe who are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verſed in the Analyſis and Syntheſis of the parts of bodies, that ebullition eſtuation, efferveſcence of febrile liquors ariſing from a pleonaſm of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſul. and ſal. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they would have it, may be appeaſed and allayed by Remedies aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vitals to make ſeparation, and afterward an excluſion every way of what is reprobate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that which is acceptable. This being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there is no fear that a plenitude ſimply of it ſelf can do any harm, for hereby ſo expedite a courſe is taken that the over-plus is in a ſhort time ſent packing by vomit, ſtool, urine, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoration and ſweat; for this reaſon conſidering what ſtrict abſtinence the Patient is put upon in a feaver, 'tis very unlikely a plenitude ſhould be of any duration. Is it not then greater prudence in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108903:72"/> a Phyſician to minorate what is ſuperfluous by ſafe, profitable ways of ſecretion and excretion, ſtill advancing the principal Agent, then for that end to give vent indiſcreetly to what comes next without any election, incommodating, if not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the loſs of the vital principles. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, whoſoever hath any great quantity of bloud taken from him either rues it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or hereafter: Let him that is Hetorodox prate what he will, alledging examples of thoſe ſturdy, luſty bodies which have hereby received immediate ſuccour, I can make good by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (and challenge any one who oppoſes me to to come to that, otherwiſe let him forbear his Garrulity) whoſoever is cured of a great mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the Lancet in this ſort, is either prone to relapſes, or to live more craſie in his younger or elder years, although for ſome ſhort time he may not by reaſon of an engrafted Robuſt conſtitution be ſenſible of theſe inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>Moreover 'tis to be noted, what redreſs is by this means in this manner received comes not from maſtering and ſubjugating the diſeaſe, but from an impoveriſhment and debellation of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> which being brought to a low condition, becomes more remiſs and impotent to conteſt with its enemy: whereupon ſome ſymptoms ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible to the ſtanders by are remitted, which a wiſe Phyſician knows are often fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a happy expulſion, if furthered by congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous volatiles, ſetting forward the Elaſtick moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>For the eſtabliſhment of what I have before delivered, let us chuſe ten the fulleſt bodies we can meet with labouring under feavers or other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108903:72"/> griefs: Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſhall have his choice of five (whom he conceives do moſt require bleeding) leaving the other five to me) to be ordered by my method. It ſhall be put to reference who cures ſooneſt, ſureſt, and ſoundeſt.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe I often obſerve many ſquaring their Therapeutick intentions according to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the feaver, endeavouring to cool thoſe who are in a great ſcorching heat, by breathing a vein, let them know that a feaver, whoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential nature is to be enquired into for the uſe of man is very erroneouſly defined, an accident for a febrile heat is certainly the product of a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going cauſe which is primarily to be ſearched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than whatſoever depends thereon will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>Now this cutting a hole in venal veſſels for the removing a bare Quality, is all one as if one ſhould lave out of the Pot ready to boil over a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous, or ſome precious Liquor therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to the intent it may thereby be quailed, neglecting to withdraw the fire, the impulſive oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the violent motion made therein. Do not they take the like abſurd courſe, who think to cool the body in a feaver by throwing away whole Porringers of Nectar of life, never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the ablation of the Cauſopoietick cauſe and focular matter ſited about the ſtomach, which makes an eſtuation and efferveſcence in all the other parts. That way of frigidation which pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages the vitals, encreaſing the malady, only aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting obliquely a tedious quality, is never to be approved of by a Legitimate Phyſician. He that will bring to a moderation the finger exceſſively heated from a Thorn impacted therein, muſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108903:73"/> extract the ſame, otherwiſe he will take a wrong courſe by the uſe of meer frigafactives. So he that will poſitively refrigerate in any preter-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat muſt eliminate that ſpinous, aculeate, acid, acrid matter which goads the <hi>Archeus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing it that it becomes exorbitant, fretting, raging. <hi>Heautontimorumenos,</hi> gauling it ſelf at the preſence of that which it abominates never to be pacifyed till it be excluded, or ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſedative given (I mean not <hi>Opium</hi> vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared) which may for a time aſſwage its fury till it can have leiſure to thruſt out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another pretended indication for ſanguimiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is Revulſion, by which they ſay a violent flux of morbifick Liquor into any noble parts is intercepted, for this end they uſe the Lancet in a Pleuriſie, Peripneumomie, or any inward inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: but how far they erre herein is well known to the beſt Practicioners, for although I confeſs they do ſometimes in the beginning ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and as it were cruſh the foreſaid diſeaſes, yet is it done accidentally, very uncertainly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of diſtraction of nature for the loſs of its ſubſtantial Treaſure, than from any true Revulſion or direct pulling back of what is in flux or already flowed in. 'Tis true, when the veſſels are depleted, a repletion is forthwith made <hi>ob fugam vacui,</hi> to avoid vacuity, but the ſupply is from what comes next: <hi>Foras intrô</hi> as well as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro foras,</hi> however there is no ſtreight immediate Revulſion intended from the part affected to the Orifice.</p>
                  <p>In the up-ſhot this is but a contingent Cure, not at all <hi>Rizotomous,</hi> which ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

For 'tis verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by obſervation, they who recover by this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſpaſtick means do for the moſt part find a great Debility ſucceeding, are incident to Empyema's, Conſumptions, and prone to relapſe into the like condition again. On the other ſide thoſe who riſe from their ſick beds, reſtored by vertue of adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Remedies are ſecured from the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diſcommodities. Aſſuredly of all thoſe Pleuriticks, I have handled above theſe half ſcore years, I have not known one after their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion procured by a legitimate form of Phyſick; either live Craſie, fall into ſecondary calamities, or recidivate into a Languor of the like Idaea.</p>
                  <p>As to that, the party of the adverſe opinion urges in behalf of Phlebotomy, that when ever there is any notable ſtagnation or coagulation in the bloud it is hereby ſet in free circulation, which liberal current being acquired, a ſubtilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſſolution is made of ſtubborn Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, obſtructing the paſſages, endangering the loſs of vital functions, I in no wiſe ſubſcribe. For ſeeing Grumoſities or Coagulations are for the moſt part contracted either in the Capillary veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels (ſeldomer in the greater, unleſs the poiſon be graduated) or out of them procured by an acid or malignant cauſe: I cannot underſtand how this depromption of the fluid juice ſhould ſo ſet in motion what is condenſed in either of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108903:74"/> places, that thereby a diſſolution can be made thereof, much leſs can aboliſh the Renet-like or venomous cauſe. Certainly were there not a wilful fallacy in mens judgments, they would eaſily perceive how the greater quantity of the ſpirituous, ſubtil, liquid part is deducted the more, contumacious to remove muſt needs be the vapid, groſs, tenacious left behind, and the <hi>Archeus</hi> made more unable to reſiſt the pungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive curdling malignity.</p>
                  <p>And although Apoplectical ſtrangulated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeem to receive benefit by ſanguimiſſion from a ſtrange unwelcome alteration ſuddenly made, which rouſes up the <hi>Archeus</hi> to exert its ultimate power to blow up the ſpark of life: <hi>Nam Animi Actiones incidente aliqua occaſione forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us agunt preſertim in Morituris</hi> ſaith <hi>Duretus.</hi> The ſoul upon a ſtreſs acts moſt vigorouſly as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in thoſe nigh death.

Wherefore the direct means to make all excretions of noxious matter in general ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is to begin with this Noble Ventricle to cleanſe away whatſoever impurity is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, or is Anarrhopon flows in thither from other parts: which is chiefly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>Per Emeſimvel Ptyſim,</hi> by vomiting or ſpitting, if nature be ſo pleaſed to throw it off this way, if not, let it be ſuch an Emetick which may ſquare with the Genius or inclination of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> to carry the morbifick matter through what ſluce it pleaſes, without damnifying or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any ill impreſſion on the ſtomach.

Secondly, neither whatſoever is fatty is eaſily convertible into ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, unleſs by ferment and addition of ſomething elſe it becomes ſaline; for as long as it remains unctuous, it doth by its laxity and ſoftneſs hinder tenſity and activity requiſite for whatſoever is ſpirituous conſiſting of ſaline particles: for if you draw over in glaſſes by what gradual heat ſoever meer oil by it ſelf an hundred times, yet ſtill will it remain oil, it may indeed be purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made more ſubtle by reaſon of the groſſer part remaining behind, as a common effect of the fire, yet cannot it be changed by this bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſo as to be properly termed a ſpirit. The efficient cauſe reckoned by the Doctor to be heat, for the framing of ſpirits is very inſufficient: For how can that be ſaid to be the principal Agent of making any thing which is made thereby, for fith as <hi>Helmont</hi> truly declares the ſpirits iſſue from a fermentation and motion of the bloud ſubtiliated and illuminated vitally; how can heat be any more than a meer adjacent or conſequent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending

               <p>'Tis one of the greateſt riddles in the world to me, that fire ſhould be actually in a place moſt uncapable of it, where great quantity of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture much abounds, or if it be really preſent, as is here aſſerted that it doth not quickly deſtroy that body where it harbours: for fire being an anomalous <hi>Ens,</hi> neither ſubſtance, nor an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, created for the ſpecial uſe of man, is always of a voracious nature, and is never ſeen but in ſome fit ſubject: which it either quickly alters or conſumes. Were there any thing of fire in mans compoſition, it would either be quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, or the frame of that body ſoon conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Neither is it enough to mitigate this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, to alledge that the purer part of the bloud &amp; ſpirits are of an igneous nature, though not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally fire or flame. This is but to puzzle &amp; wilder our underſtanding, to make us more to ſeek what the ſpirits are: for if they be fiery, they muſt needs have in them that which agrees with the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fire, as to burn, conſume, inflame, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: otherwiſe the Epithete is very ill appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated thereto: now according to our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, <hi>Non verus cenſetur ignis, qui non ſummo gradu ferveat connexiis Radiis in Cono Luminis centraliter haereat, i. e.</hi> that can never be reputed real fire, which is not hot in the higheſt degree, inhering centrally in the beams conjoyned in the cone of Light, whether there be any ſuch graduated heat in mans body, let any judge by his ſenſe of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Who ever felt any thing of fire in the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bloud of any animal diſſected alive. Are not the bloud of fiſhes actually cold? yet are they full of ſpirits, as appears by their ſtrength, pernicity, and extraordinary digeſtion.</p>

               <p>Will any vertuous perſon experimentous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, that a Chimaerical heat of a fiery nature, I know not where, nor what, no way truly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable can produce this rare vital Analytical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Moreover, fire can but heat, rarefie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe, and diſgregate, ſending packing the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part, the groſſer remaining behind: but it can never make a ſeminal formal tranſmutation of a thing which only belongs to fermental ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, excited by an accidental heat, but never intrinſecally fabricated thereby, as our Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick undertakes to indigitate, making light to paſs over the myſtery of fermentation, <hi>ſicco pede,</hi> as if it conſiſted in nothing elſe but a certain Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction from heat, chiefly fire, that being a bare quality never ſubſiſting alone, in no wiſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it ſelf to produce a ſubſtance, that a Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclite creature deſtinated to deſtroy, not to generate; for as much as it certainly mortifies

               <p>That the eſſential ſtructure of the vital ſpirit may be more clearly underſtood, for the ſanative benefit of mankind I ſhall borrow our Great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers definition, pag. 443. <hi>de Aura vit.

               <p>Touching its Facture or framing, although it be reckoned one of my Medical Secrets of the Lower Claſs, yet I ſhall ſtill keep it within the Walls of my Ergaſtery or Chymical working place, till I perceive more Sincerity, Candour, and Gratitude abroad, than hitherto I have found.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe there are ſome botching Mimetick Chymiſts, who will not be wanting to attempt to ſophiſticate, adulterate it, impoſing upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting perſons their ſhadow for this ſubſtance, of ſuch I adviſe all to beware, for they will but diſgrace and degrade the Medicine, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of mans health, and abuſe of the Art. For this I can aſſeverate, none ſhall ever without ſtrict inſtructions ever find out the right Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Manufacture thereof, unleſs he himſelf be both Agent and Patient, that ſo he may be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the exquiſite guſt, and peculiar taſt of his own ſtomach, how to be able to correct his aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the purification or exaltation of every ſingle Concrete, as alſo afterwards to make a right connexion or combination of the ſame, that they may be brought to act <hi>tono uniſono,</hi> in an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious manner. Take this ſhort deſcription of it: It is in colour uſually like Amber, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much more intenſe, even Ruddy. In O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Sapour very piercing, being very vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, endued with great tenuity of parts, it ſeems to be for the preſent a potential fire, as it were a Cauſtick, threatning an <hi>Eſchar:</hi> yet is it moſt innocent, congruous to the <hi>Archeus</hi> or vitals, ſtrengthning the part it toucheth, leaving not the leaſt ill impreſſion behind, ſo that I can put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my eye without the leaſt hurt, and have often diſtilled it into my ear.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:108903:88"/>
               <p>It doth as much tranſcend for medicinal uſe the common ſpirit or Oil of Sulphur, Vitriol, Salt, ſuch like fretting corroſive Liquors, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum lenta ſolent inter viburna Cupreſſi,</hi> as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond exceeds an Acorn in goodneſs. It is moſt durable not to be corrupted, only it hath Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial wings, it will quickly take its flight if it be not kept cloſe Priſoner.</p>
               <p>I dare maintain there is not a Medicine of this Rank in the Nation more active, efficacious, ſafe, of more general profit for the life of man: (this Poſterity will allow when it ſhall ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it) than this <hi>Alexi Stomachon.</hi> Yea 'tis pleaſant enough if rightly ordered with a proper vehicle, unleſs to thoſe nice, waiward, untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unreaſonable prejudiced perſons, whom like Children, hardly any thing will pleaſe if it go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Bugbear name of Chymical.</p>
               <p>The vertue of this <hi>Alexi ſtomachon</hi> given expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally, is of ſo admirable uſe, that I may in verity aver it is able without an Hyperbole (let the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> unſavoury humoriſt value it as he pleaſe) to weigh down the monſtrous bulk of an Apothecaries ſhop.</p>
               <p>It powerfully corroborates the ſpirits, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and digeſtion of the ſtomach, rectifies the Spleen, diſcuſſes, expels flatuoſity, wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſweetens in ſome meaſure the ſharpneſs of the Latex, or any fretting juice. It ſubtilly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the Veins and Arteries, being circulated with the bloud, which it very much mundifies. It is Diaphoretick, cauſing a kindly breathing in the skin. It is alſo ſomewhat Diuretick, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off gravel from the Kidneys, hindring that it be not engendred, being helpful in the Dyſurie
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108903:89"/> and Strangurie. 'Tis of great ſervice againſt pains in the ſide, the Colick, Griping of the Guts. It is Cordial, preſerving from Lypothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, reſtoring thoſe who are ſurprized with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or fainting of the ſpirits. It is Anti-ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick, prevalent againſt the Scurvy. Anti-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, good againſt venomous Contagious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. Antipyreton, effectual to anticipate fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as likewiſe to help to cure the ſame. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidypſon, an excellent quencher of the Thirſt, taking off preternatural heat or cold, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the efficient cauſe, reducing the parts to an Eucraſie. Anti-hyſtericon, affords aid againſt fits of the Mother, the Whites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It diſſolves coagulations and grumoſities, maturates crudities, abates a nauſeous diſpoſition or vomiting, ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liates and cleanſeth away ſlimy tenacious flegm, giving eaſe in difficulty of breathing, mitigating the violence of the Tiſſick. It is available againſt melancholly Imaginations, Hypochondriack paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Cachexies, Dropſies, Atrophies. The frequent uſe thereof ſtrengthens the Brain, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, Loins, invigorating the Memory, and all the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Being outwardly applyed it challenges Noble effects. For 'tis very healing, Balſamical, curing green Wounds and Soars, being lightly touched therewith often repeated. I have found it very commodious in Ambuſtion, ſcaldings, burnings: Some drops being frequently diſtilled thereon, forced inwardly by the bottom of a ſmooth glaſs.</p>
               <p>I cannot but commend it experimentally, as a ſingular Antiodontalgick, one of the beſt Anodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or aſſwagers of the pains of the Teeth I have
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108903:89"/> met with hitherto, being of great force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from corruption, withall reſiſting the putrefaction of the Gums.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be contemned for the mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pains of any part, ſtrengthning or quickning the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or vital ſpirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>With many more laudable properties is this <hi>Alexi-ſtomachon</hi> endued, which frequent uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and a longer, ſtrict, ſedulous practice will bring to light.</p>
               <p>The quantity to be exhibited is of great Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, from one to ten: yea, I will undertake to give twenty times as much as the common porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the leaſt injury to any.</p>
               <p>The ordinary Doſe is twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, ſixty drops in a draught of any ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as Beer, Ale, Wine, or whatſoever doth beſt reliſh with the perſon.</p>
               <p>There is no need of being preciſe or curious concerning the time of taking it: for when any one is Cacoſtomachical, troubled with indigeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wind, pain, gripes, or any of the foreſaid affects, let him take liberally thereof.</p>
               <p>He that conſtantly takes every morning thirty or forty drops, ſhall prevent many miſchiefs in reference to his health.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant the Galeniſts (whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in theſe Philoſophical Manufactures, and the experimental uſe of this and other Spagyrical Remedies are as much depraved, as the taſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man in a high feaver) will not be wanting according to their former Tenour, raſhly to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure openly, or at leaſt privately to ſugillate this ſalutiferous medicine, carping at it as too hot,

Such like defaming undervaluing Language I expect from ſome malevolents. But bleſſed be my Stars, my ſenſe of Abuſes herein is become Callous: for I vallue not their obloquies, being aſſured I can eaſily wipe of any of theſe Aſperſions.</p>
               <p>As to what is objected, that this ſtomach-ſpirit is too hot, burning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, whatſoever is ſo properly denominated, muſt either harbour ſome corroſive fretting ſalt, highly exaſperating the <hi>Archeus.</hi> Or 2. Abundance of Recrements diſcrepant, burdenſome, offenſive to Nature. Or 3. A Clandeſtine poiſon, whoſe fermenteſcent Corpuſcles being hoſtile to the vitals, ſtir up a preternatural ebullition, efferveſcence in the juices, ſo conſequently an exceſſive heat.</p>
               <p>That there is no ſuch evil endowment or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in this medicine, I am fully certified by experiment, and can make evident. 1. That the Textures of its particles are not in the leaſt fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, gauling, or burning, but are ſymbolical and amicable to the Animal ſpirits, ſweetly cloſing in with them. 2. That it is defaecated, rid of any impurity which may give the ſtomach any trouble in digeſtion, ſo that it is no ſooner admitted, but becomes a welcome pleaſing Gueſt, having free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to exſpatiate every way, no whit fettered
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108903:90"/> with any droſs or filth. 3. It is ſo far from any malignity, venenoſity, or virulency that it is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticacoethes, Antiphthora, an Antidote or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſon mortifying <hi>(pro modulo)</hi> contagious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, keeping Liquors from Hyperzymôſis ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-fermentation, a tendency to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The terrefying phantaſm of conſuming the Radical moiſture doth not a jot concern this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: ſith it in no wiſe acts proportionable to the flame on Oil, Tallow, or Wax: for theſe the more they are accenſed, the greater expence is made of them, therefore ſooner exhauſted. On the other ſide, the more there is an Eclampſis, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgeſcence, Radiation of the vital Light by means of this ſhining ſpirit, the more any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the ferments and conſtitutives of the body are repaired, a prevention being made of their future decay, and ſo the life prolonged.</p>
               <p>This vain conceit doth truly ſquare with the Galenical, not the <hi>Helmontian</hi> Doctrine, which as I have before explained, will not admit of the efficient material cauſe of ſpirits, to be pingued<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Herein it appears how diametrical oppoſite the method of the Galeniſts and <hi>Helmontians</hi> are as well in Diet as Pharmacy: they make it their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pleaſe the Palate for the preſent; withall to peſſundate and ſtarve the animal Genius, for the avoidance of ſome petty inconveniencies, as too much heating or drying, giving thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and more force to the diſeaſe. Theſe <hi>i. e. Helmontians</hi> put out their utmoſt endeavours fontally to extirpate what is noxious, indulging and animating the <hi>Archeus,</hi> that it may be enabled to profligate its enemy (not ſtartled in a vulgar manner at ſome ſeemingly frightful appearances, as extraordinary heat, an inquietude, a little ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, a ſwerving from right reaſon) being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed that theſe are but the effects or fruits, of an Hormetick motion in the ſpirits excited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by good Liquors, eaſily united with them for the routing and putting to flight every way whatſoever doth diſturb its vital Government.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108903:94"/> the Root is plucked up. Moreover moſt or all vehement feavers have at this day notable malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in them: Certainly then according to the beſt Reaſon and ſoundeſt experiments, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the late Plague, the moſt generous Liquors of the ſubtileſt ſmack are in this caſe to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited largely without inſiſting upon the nicety of any danger from heating, which though it be a terriculament to them, yet to me it is great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of a happy evaſion: For I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ill conditioned ſeavers as moſt mortal, where there is but the mildeſt heat manifeſted, by pulſe, urine, and contact of the skin.

               <p>Permit the febrile Patient to drink at any time when he is very thirſty, but let the potulent or what is drinkable be well impregnated or filled with a ſufficient quantity of ſpirits.</p>

               <p>If the infirm deſire mace Ale, I ſhall not deny him: ſuppoſe it be well Aromariſed, the Liquor being but very little boiled, leaſt the more ſubtil virtuous part fly away: of which over-ſight ſome incogitant Phyſicians are frequently guilty, for want of inſight into diſtillation: this is the Diet which I injoyn my Patients, always pleaſing their appetites with what is tolerable, excluding Broths, Water-gruel, or whatſoever is not live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Although I have no great kindneſs for Milk, yet in protracted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, I admoniſh all labouring under them to be more ſollicitous for their fluid than ſollid food, for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Aphoriſm dictates: <hi>Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us eſt refici potu quam cibo, i. e.</hi> according to our expoſition ſuitable to Chymical Obſervations: Any one feeble may ſooner be revived, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtrength by thin, luſty, hearty daring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, as Wine, the ſpirit of Mault, or any other vegetable, than by groſs, lazie, rude, blunt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Kitchin.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I have ſometimes conſidered of how great a Deception, ſome Culinary Doctors are guilty in prohibiting their Patients (infeſted with the Stone, Gout, Scurvy, Tiſſick, and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies) the lawful uſe of common Salt, the moſt neceſſary commodious creature next the Sun for the welfare of mans life. Now the reaſon they give for this prohibition is (as they often dictate to the ſick) that it engenders ſalt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108903:96"/> encreaſing the ſaline matter of diſeaſes. I confeſs I cannot altogether exempt Table ſalt from ſome little inconvenience (which moſt things are liable to) yet if the great benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be comparatively weighed with the damage that doth far tranſcend this. For it is a great preſerver againſt corruption, moſt grateful to the ſtomach, which it corroborates, exciting an appetite. It attenuates, cleanſes, diſſolves, muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous excrements: being a great enemy to worms, yea as <hi>Helmont</hi> notes, pag. 20. <hi>de Lithi,</hi> eaten in large quantity, it hinders the coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Stone, deſtroying it while it is in the Egg. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commended it in his time as a powerful Antidote againſt the Plague. Let none therefore fear to eat ſalt freely with their freſh meat, nor any food well corned (only forbearing if they can) ſhip fleſh or fiſh, whoſe beſt alible juice is conſumed by long exceſſive Conditure: the more volatile parts of the Salt being exhaled or become fixed) for ſome part thereof is made urinous, the reſt being diſcharged by the Inteſtines or Kidneys, with profit to the health.

               <p>It is obvions to any circumſpect obſerver, that our corporal infirmities as well as our mental vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are at this day exceedingly multiplyed and magnified in ſuch ſort, that Phyſicians are ſtartled to ſee them ſo inſulting and raging, ſuch innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truculent terrible ſymptoms accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them: yet for all this, very few labour to acquire, applicate, and appropriate Remedies proportionable to the grandity of our evils. Nay rather they who attempt ſo noble a deſign, are diſcouraged, being looked upon as ſo many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in Phyſick.</p>
               <p>There hath of late among other upſtart, feral Plagues, appeared upon the Stage of this little World, a ſtrange Heteroclite Monſter called the Scurvy, acting its part continually in divers ſhapes, counterfeiting the guiſe of all or moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes. Sometimes it conſumes by little and little, as it were grating and crumbling one into the Grave: then again it rends, diſtracts,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108903:97"/> ſeparates the union of body and ſoul in a very ſhort ſpace ſuddenly puffing out the Lamp of life. Now it ſeems to be Couchant, then Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant: ſo alternately Acute and Chronick.</p>
               <p>Among multitude of Phaenomena or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of this grievous calamity, there is none at this day more eminently Atrocious, than this termed the Griping of the Guts, which although it paſſeth among the vulgar for a ſubſtantial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, yet is it in reality only a Product, Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, Accident fruit or effect of a Scorbutical virulent Root, which muſt be ſtruck at if any good be done to a purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I plainly perceived the Scurvy long before the late moſt fierce Peſt brake forth, did gradually get ſtrength, ſpreading it ſelf in an extrordinary contagious form, inſomuch as it arrived accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my prediction, to a high pitch of venenoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, making havock of thouſands.

Theſe Torminous Griping pains have ſeveral other ſigns and ſymptoms accompanying them as a feaver manifeſt or hidden, Vertigo or Giddineſs, Cephalalgie, great pains of the head, a Sopor or drowſineſs, tedious watching, phrenſie or alienation from right reaſon, laſſitude, notable weakneſs of the limbs, difficult breathing, a pulſe commonly weak, inordinate, a palpitation or trembling at the heart, Lypothimie, fainting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, oftentimes great drought, ſoarneſs of the Throat, rough dry Tongue, pains about the ſides, Haemorrhagies, fluxes of bloud, Cardiogmus, heart-burning, oppreſſion at the ſtomach, a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſneſs or loathing of every thing, yexing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable torment in the loins, ſpots lying deep in the fleſh, hardly to be diſcerned, urine for the moſt part like one in health, ſometimes thick and troubled.</p>
